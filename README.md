# Programming Paradigms Homework Assignments

Welcome to my repository showcasing completed homework assignments for the Programming Paradigms course. This repository features assignments focused on three different programming paradigms: Lambda Calculus, Functional Programming with Racket, and Logic Programming with Prolog.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Lambda Calculus
Lambda Calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application. This assignment demonstrates my understanding of the theoretical foundations of functional programming languages and the use of lambda expressions to represent functions.

### 2. Functional Programming with Racket
Functional Programming is a paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. Racket, a descendant of Scheme, is a functional programming language that provides powerful abstractions and a rich set of libraries. This assignment highlights my ability to solve complex problems using functional techniques and Racket's features.

### 3. Logic Programming with Prolog
Logic Programming is a paradigm based on formal logic. Prolog is a logic programming language used for solving problems involving complex relationships and rules. This assignment showcases my skills in writing programs that perform logical reasoning and demonstrate the declarative nature of Prolog.
